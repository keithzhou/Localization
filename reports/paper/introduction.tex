\section{Background}
Points with the same time difference of arrival(TDOA) to two fixed points on a plane form a hyperbola. Since TDOA from each pair of microphones gives a hyperbola in the plane, localization becomes finding intersection of hyperbolas when more than two microphones are used. Localization relies on accurate estimate of delay differences between microphones.

Generalized Cross Correlation(GCC) provides a framework to estimate delay differences $t_0$ between two signals $x_1(t)$ and $x_2(t)$:
\begin{eqnarray} \label{eq:gcc}
t_0 &=& \arg\max_{\tau} R_{x_1x_2}(\tau) \\
R_{x_1x_2}(\tau) &=& \int_{-\infty}^\infty W(\omega) X_1(\omega) X_2^{*}(\omega) e^{j\omega\tau} d\omega
\end{eqnarray}
, where $X_1(\omega)$ and $X_2(\omega)$ are Fourier Transform of $x_1(t)$ and $x_2(t)$. $W(\omega)$ provides a way to prefilter signals passed to cross correlation estimator. We experimented with three ways of prefiltering the signal:
\begin{description}[\IEEEsetlabelwidth{Very very long label}\IEEEusemathlabelsep]
\item[GCC] $W(\omega) = 1$. No prefiltering is done. This is normal cross correlation.
\item[GCC\_PHAT] $W(\omega) = \frac{1}{\left|X_1(\omega)X_2^{*}(\omega)\right|}$. Each frequency is divideded by its magnitude. Only phase information contributes to delay estimation.
\item[GCC\_PHAT\_SQRT] $W(\omega) = \frac{1}{\left|X_1(\omega)X_2^*(\omega)\right|^{0.5}}$. This is somewhere between GCC and GCC\_PHAT. part of magnitude information is included in delay estimation.
